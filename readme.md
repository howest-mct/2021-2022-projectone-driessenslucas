## About The Project



For the final project in the first year of my studies I decided to make a remote controlled coffee machine named COF-FI

functionalities:
* make coffee from anywhere as long as you have internet access
* track how much coffee you've made each week
* check how much water there is in the reservoir
* detects if there is a coffee pot underneath the machine
* measure temperature of the coffee machine
